## Introduction

In this project, I've created a user-friendly interface that showcases the following key concepts:

- **Components**: I've organized the interface into reusable components to keep the code modular and maintainable.
- **JSX**: JSX is used for rendering elements and creating the user interface.
- **Props**: Data for each step is passed as props to the components, allowing for dynamic content.
- **useState**: I utilize the `useState` hook to manage the state of the current step.
- **State Management**: The "Next" and "Previous" buttons change the step by updating the state, demonstrating a basic form of state management.

## Features

- **Step Navigation**: Users can navigate through different steps using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
- **Dynamic Content**: The content of each step is customizable through props, making it easy to update and add new steps.
- **State Management**: The project illustrates the use of `useState` for simple state management.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/steps.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd steps
3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```shell
    npm install

Once you've installed the project and its dependencies, you can start the development server with the following command:

    npm start

This will launch the "Steps" app in your default web browser. You can explore the step-by-step interface and see how components, JSX, props, and useState work together for dynamic content and simple state management.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure:
